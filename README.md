# Modern-KPop-Analysis
## Description
I gathered data of the kpop group industry using a personally coded webscraper which holds general information such as name and debut year from a [Kpop database website](dbkpop.com) to conduct a analysis on the data.
I personally started this project for fun to get to learn data science and obtain data analysis skills.
## Contents 
- csv files of male kpop groups and female kpop
- 2 webscraper programs 
- Addblocker.crx (needed if want to use webscraper)
- DataAnalysis.ipynb 

I made the 2 webscraper programs because the table containing kpop artists differs from the one that contains kpop groups. They essentially handle different cases, but the frame is the same.
