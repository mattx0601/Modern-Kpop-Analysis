# Modern-KPop-Analysis
## Description
I gathered data of the kpop group industry using a personally built webscraper which holds general information such as name and debut year from a [Kpop database website](dbkpop.com) to conduct a analysis on the data.
I personally started this project for fun to get to learn data science and obtain data analysis skills.
